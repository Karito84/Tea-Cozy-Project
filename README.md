# Tea-Cozy-Project
flexbox and responsive web design

In this project, I was responsible for creating a fictional tea shop website. 

Codecademy provided a source of instructions - design spec and image assets to help me along the way. 
 
This project assumed that I was able to reproduce the basic HTML and 
CSS with little guidance.
